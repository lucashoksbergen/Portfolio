  "Underwater Cooperation",
  `This was a project that I worked on during the second half of 2022-2023 with a team of 5 people.
  For this project I was the programmer.
  The goal of this project was to make a serious game to promote people with cooperating,
  as well as teaching them how to do this in a natural manner.
  <br><br>
  The game is made using Unity and C#, it is also the first time
  I experimented with adding local multiplayer to a game. As is visible in the demo below, 
  one of the features of the game is that every decision you make dynamically updates on everyone's version of the game. 
  <br><br>
  The main gameplay-loop of the game is every player making
  independent choices that affect general statistics negatively or positively,
  with the goal of the game being to keep all of these balanced. 
  The difficulty here arises in the fact that the players do not know what choices the others are making,
  and have to discuss this, without mentioning the specifics of their decisions. 
  <br><br>
  The game uses the concept of a crew on a submarine making decisions regarding their resources as a metaphor for a team working together.

  "Hexagon Game",
  `This was a project that I worked on during the first half of 2022-203 with two other classmates.
   For this project we had about a week to create a game. I was the programmer of this game,
   with the others working on visuals. The game is made in Unity with C#.
   <br><br>
   The goal of the game is to collect all the yellow cubes, 
   these representing various resources needed to repair your ship. 
   One can collect these by building a route, which is done through the placing of hexagon-shaped tiles.
   This reduces one's oxygen however, and once you run out, you lose.
   <br><br>
   The main goal of this game was to make a digital version of a boardgame that could be played individually.

  "Elemental Escape",
  `This project was a game I made on my own in around 2-3 weeks.
   The goal of this was to create a game with components of emergent gameplay,
    as well as procedural level generation. 
    <br><br>
    The main concept of the game is a side-scrolling roguelike game where you
    use various elements to move throughout the map and defeat various enemies.
    This was executed through two elements, which have their own gameplay abilities,
    allowing the player to solve encounters in different ways.
    Another part of this game is how the levels are semi-randomly generated.
    This is because the levels are random combinations of several presets of room types,
    ensuring that the overall map layout is different every time.
    <br><br>
    The game was made in Unity,
    with the spritework being made in Aseprite.

  "AirBar Planet Infographic",
  `This project was a project that was made for Indietopia, 
  with the goal of experimenting with the technology of an airbar. 
  This being a device that can be plugged into a computer to simulate touch, using infra-red sensors.
  Our mission in this, however was to use this in such a manner that it can be used without touch,
  meaning one can use it by simply moving their hands in the air.
  Thus we created a demonstration of what can be done using such a device, when used for places such as musea,
  by making an interactive page with the planets of the solar system.
  <br><br>
  For this project, I was one of the two developers, me being responsible for the drag-and-drop functionalities.
  These had to be made from scratch, since they had to work with touch-based inputs, which does not natively have support for drag-and-drop functionality in JavaScript.
  The creation of this prototype took around a week.

  "Op Jezelf App",
  `This is the most recent project I worked on.
  This app was made in correlation with a board-game for Op Jezelf,
   which is a combined group of several housing corporations that give lessons to various people about living on your own.
   The goal of this project was to create a more interesting and engaging way of giving these lessons, for which a serious game was made.
   The digital part of this project was made by me, and took me about two weeks.
   <br><br>
   The goal of this app is to simulate a bank-app, which will be used in correlation with a board-game, to simulate the first three months of living on your own.
   The game focuses on teaching the players how to balance their budget, which is done through giving them various choices throughout the game to possibly save money.
   The game relies on the players making the wrong choices, so they can be educated on how to do the correct choices at the end.
    Hence why the similarities to reality are important. Given that the goal is to teach the users better behaviour.
    <br><br>
    The preview below showcases the functionalities of the app, however it is primarily made for mobile devices, hence why the scale might seem off.

  `This was a project made in UnReal Engine 5, for The Imagineers.
   The goal of this was to experiment with creating a digital visitor's centre in UnReal Engine.
   For this project I was one of the two programmers that worked on the project,
   in which we worked with BluePrints.
   I created the general movement and camera movement and the interactive elements, which are demonstrated in the video below.
   <br><br>
   The project was a proof of concept for creating an interactive visitor's centre that should function like one that could be used in browsers, hence the mouse-based movement.
   The project was also made to be used by people willing to visit a visitor's centre, which meant the target audience included less tech-experienced users.
   We tried to make it easier for them to use by using commonly used symbols, as well as making the interactive elements stand out more, with responsive feedback on hover.
   <br><br>
   This project was done during the first half of 2022-2023, where we had a couple of weeks to create this.
